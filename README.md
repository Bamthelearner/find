# FIN - Flow Identity Network

Flow does not have any equivalent to ENS or any way to lookup a user by a tag/alias/nick. 

Fin is here to solve that issue. 

In order to use FIN you create your Flow Identity and store that in your account. Then you can optionally register that with FIN for a small yearly fee. 

FIN is priced on a sliding scale from 0.1 for tags with 6+ characters to 0.6 for single character tags.

## Flow Identity
Right now an Identity in FIN is a single user. 

A user "is" an NFT that is you send in a NFT to represent you as your avatar. Note that currently the NFT standard is not rich enough to do this, so I have added a content field to the NFT interface in this contract as an example. 

An identity also has a wallet capability linked that you can send money into. 


## Plans

 - Add group identity, that is a set of FlowIdentities that collaborate on income. The Group will have a wallet set up with given fractions and when any user in the group wants to distribute money it is distributed according to that fraction. Using the flow-sharded-wallet
 - Add pool identity, a set of FlowIdentities that collaborate on funding something. The group will pool FT according to the given fractions and when everybody has pooled the flow will be moved to a central wallet that can then be transfered or used to stake a node
 - Add community identity, the combination of pool and group. Coolborate on both income and funding

 - Add support for sending friend requests and adding friends. Showing fiends. Sending public messages to a friend.
 - Add support for Identity strength
 - Add support for storing information that the Identity has gone through KYC with a given provider. 



# Flow Identity and the Flow Identity Network

Right now there is no sentral place of finding some more information about users on Flow. People have to remeber a 16 digit address in order to identify themselves and there is not way to share KYC information, or link profiles together.

Flow Identity Network aim to fix all that.

Flow Identity
 - is a Receiver, Balance of FT
  - the default is to use a capability to the build in flow wallet, but can be changed
 - is a INFT so that a user can identity with a given featured NFT
 - has a private KYC information that other contracts can request, and that the owner of the profile can approve
 - when a Identity is verified for KYC against a wallet provider that information can be queried by others
  - so a minor player can find out "is this profile verified with TopShot or Blocto"
 - can link they Identity to another identity, that other identity has to confirm the link.
  - social network on flow? ðŸ˜„ (i wrote this before Roham tweet)
 - can have a overview of NFT collections so that profile contracts can discover the NFTs a profile has

Flow Identity Network
 - a Flow Identity can lease an alias in the Network against a small fee
  - when a lease run out the alias cannot be claimed until a given freeze period so that the user can release and not risk missing their alias
