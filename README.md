# FIND - Flow Integrated Name Directory

Flow does not have any equivalent to ENS or any way to lookup a user by a name/alias/nick. 

FIND is here to solve that issue. 

In order to use FIND you create your Flow Identity/Profile and store that in your account. Then you can optionally register that with FIND for a small yearly fee. 

FIND is priced with inspiration from ENS. 5 FUSD for a name a year. If you want 4 characters it is going to cost you 100 FUSD and 3 characters 500 FUSD.

## Flow Identity

Right now an Identity in FIND is a single user.  It uses the Versus profile to represent a user.
