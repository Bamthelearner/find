# FIN - Flow Identity Network

Flow does not have any equivalent to ENS or any way to lookup a user by a tag/alias/nick. 

Fin is here to solve that issue. 

In order to use FIN you create your Flow Identity and store that in your account. Then you can optionally register that with FIN for a small yearly fee. 

FIN is priced on a sliding scale from 0.1 for tags with 6+ characters to 0.6 for single character tags.

## Flow Identity

Right now an Identity in FIN is a single user.  It uses the Versus profile to represent a user.


## Plans

 - heavily test with gwtf
 - better comments


# Flow Identity and the Flow Identity Network

Right now there is no sentral place of finding some more information about users on Flow. People have to remeber a 16 digit address in order to identify themselves and there is not way to share KYC information, or link profiles together.

Flow Identity Network aim to fix all that.

Flow Identity
 - is a versus profile

Flow Identity Network
 - a Flow Identity can lease an alias in the Network against a small fee in FUSD
  - when a lease run out the alias cannot be claimed until a given freeze period so that the user can release and not risk missing their alias
